# data-science-ny-resolution
I just finished by undergraduate degree in social sciences where I focused on Political Sciences. After I've written my bachelor thesis 
on the influence of lobbyists on the European Union using data science, I knew I wanted to do more. 

A lot of interesting questions can be asked by using data science on political problems. That is why I made it my New Year's resolution to 
learn about data science. 

I upload all of my projects here and I write about it here:

If you have any feedback on my code, my writing or anything else, always let me know. :)
